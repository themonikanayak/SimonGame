# Simon Game
May 2021

• Developed a web version of the popular Simon Game, an electronic game of memory skill.

• It creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails, the game is over.

• Created using HTML, CSS, and jQuery.
